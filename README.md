# Competitor Analytics for Etsy Shops

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing competitor Etsy shops to derive actionable insights that can enhance market strategy and profitability. By examining the posting behaviors and pricing strategies of competitors, the project aims to leverage data analytics for informed decision-making, ultimately leading to a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

## Objectives
The main objectives of the project are as follows:

1. **Trend Analysis**: To investigate the frequency and timing of new item postings by competitors to identify emerging trends and consumer interests.
  
2. **Profit Projection**: To calculate future expected profits for specific products based on historical posting data, pricing strategies, and market demand.
  
3. **SEO Performance Assessment**: To analyze the SEO ranking of competitor listings to understand their visibility and effectiveness in attracting potential customers.
  
4. **Strategic Reporting**: To generate comprehensive reports that provide insights and recommendations for enhancing market positioning and sales strategies.

## Methodology
The project employs a structured approach to data analysis, utilizing a MySQL database to store relevant information gathered, through web scraping, from various Etsy shops. The following Python libraries and methodologies were integral to the analysis:

- **Data Acquisition and Storage**: 
  - **MySQL**: The scraped data was organized in a structured database, ensuring efficient retrieval and manipulation.
  - **SQLAlchemy**: For database interaction, querying, and management.

  
- **Data Processing and Analysis**: 
  - **Pandas**: This library was used extensively for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). It enabled the handling of large datasets with ease, facilitating operations like merging, filtering, and aggregating data.
  - **NumPy**: Utilized for numerical computations to derive statistical insights and perform calculations relevant to profit projections.

- **Reporting**: 
  - **ReportLab**: This library enabled the generation of professional-grade PDF reports, encapsulating the analysis results in a visually appealing format. Each report included key metrics, visualizations, and detailed explanations of findings.

## Results and Key Insights
The analysis yielded a wealth of insights regarding the competitor shops:

### Posting Behavior
- **Frequency of New Item Postings**: 
  The analysis revealed the average number of times items were posted as "New Item Posted" (NIP) by competitors, which served as a metric for assessing marketing effectiveness. For example, one shop posted a particular item as NIP eight times within a specific period.
 

### Financial Projections
- **Expected Profit Calculations**: 
  By correlating the posting frequency with average sale prices, projections were made on potential earnings. For instance, if a shop lists an item as NIP 8 times with an average sale price of $6.00, projected earnings per year were estimated to be around $4,779.60 based on historical data.

### SEO Analysis
- **SEO Ranking Insights**: 
  A detailed review of SEO ranking data revealed that competitor shops maintained specific page rankings and positions, impacting their visibility to potential customers. This analysis identified opportunities for improvement in SEO strategies.

### Strategic Recommendations
 Based on the insights gathered, several recommendations were proposed:
  - **Adjust Pricing Strategies**: To align pricing with competitors based on the observed trends and profit projections.
  - **Optimize Listing Frequency**: Increase the posting frequency of popular items to enhance visibility and attract more customers.
  - **Enhance SEO Practices**: Implement targeted SEO strategies to improve ranking positions, thereby increasing organic traffic to the shop.

## Conclusion
This project underscores the value of data analytics in understanding and navigating the competitive landscape of e-commerce. By employing Python for data manipulation, analysis, and reporting, the project not only highlights current trends but also equips stakeholders with the insights necessary to make informed business decisions. The findings can significantly enhance the strategic positioning and profitability of the analyzed Etsy shop, illustrating the effectiveness of leveraging data for competitive advantage.
